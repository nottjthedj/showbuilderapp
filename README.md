# Show Builder — event platform edition

Recreate the **Grand Theft After-Dark** event system for any brand from a single set
of config files. Fill in the blanks, drop in your logo + show data, run one command,
and get a complete, deployable multi-module site — the same proven formula every time.

> **What GTAD is:** a live, lore-driven interactive game-show. Guests scan a QR on
> arrival, get "made" into the crew, and play through a night of missions run by the
> host ("the Handler"). This tool stamps out that whole experience — booth, crew card,
> and host console — re-skinned for a new brand.

## Modules it generates

| Module | File(s) | Who uses it | What it does |
|--------|---------|-------------|--------------|
| **Crew Card** *(player, front door)* | `index.html` / `crew.html` | guests | The **front door** — one scan of the domain lands here: scan-to-get-made card with member number, **tonight's Job** + Handler transmission, live **Wanted Level**, **missions**, live **votes**, and a button into the booth. |
| **Photo Booth** | `booth.html`, `gallery.html`, `setup.html`, `netlify/` | guests + operator | Branded camera → photo/video with your overlay → save/share/opt-in. Includes the **gallery admin** (approve/delete) and the secure **Backblaze-B2 → NAS** pipeline. |
| **Handler Console** *(admin)* | `handler.html` | the host | Chapter picker (your whole season), the opening-transmission **teleprompter**, a **mission picker** (pick 3, with props/how-to/VO + the full **scene script** for each), Wanted-Level control, and a **QR generator** that hands guests a crew card pre-loaded with tonight's setup. Links to the gallery. |

The Booth ships for every brand. The **Crew Card + Handler Console** are generated only
when the config includes a **`show`** (your chapters + missions) — see below.

## Desktop app — Show Builder (share this with people)

**Show Builder** is a double-click app (no terminal, no Python) for making branded
sites. Fill in the blanks, pick colours, drop in a logo, click **Generate site…** →
out comes a ready-to-deploy folder. It starts pre-loaded with the GTAD preset, and
you can **Save config…** / **Open config…** to share brand setups as small JSON files.

**Get the app:** the GitHub Actions **“Build Show Builder”** workflow builds it for
**Windows (.exe)**, **macOS (.app)** and **Linux** — download from the run's *Artifacts*
(or attach them to a `v*` release). To build it yourself:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
cd show-builder-app
pyinstaller show-builder.spec        # -> dist/"Show Builder"(.exe / .app)
```

First-launch note (unsigned app): **Windows** → “More info → Run anyway”;
**macOS** → right-click the app → **Open** the first time.

Prefer the command line? The generator underneath is `make_booth.py`:

## Quick start (CLI)

```bash
# reproduce the real show (booth + crew card + handler console)
python3 make_booth.py brands/gtad.json

# a booth-only brand (no show data)
python3 make_booth.py brands/example-midnight-arcade.json
```

Output lands in `build/<projectSlug>/`. Drag that folder onto **app.netlify.com/drop**,
then follow the generated `SETUP.md`. No dependencies — just Python 3.10+.

## What you change (per brand)

| File | Controls |
|------|----------|
| `brands/<brand>.json` | Branding (name, logo lockup, kicker, hashtag, CTA, **legal line**), the **colour scheme**, socials, web/deploy info, and a pointer to the show file. |
| `brands/<brand>.show.json` | The **show**: your season of chapters (codename, act, the job, the Handler transmission) and your missions (props, how-it-runs, win, Handler VO, **scene**, variation) + vocabulary and Wanted-Level labels. |
| your logo image | White-on-transparent PNG, embedded + burned into captures. Optional (text lockup fallback). |

Everything the formula keeps fixed — the camera flow, the three photo frames, the
crew-card mechanics, the console's teleprompter/mission-picker/QR tooling — stays put.

`brands/gtad.show.json` is the real GTAD bible — **24 chapters** (a full 3-act season)
and **11 missions** — extracted from the production docs. Copy it to start a new show.

### Two voices

A show has two distinct speaking layers, and the console keeps them apart:

| | Where | What it is |
|---|---|---|
| **Transmission** *(cinematic)* | `chapters[].transmission` | The story beat that opens the night. In-fiction, no winking — the host is the character. One per night; each opens on the previous night's `endsOn` so the season reads as one arc. |
| **Scene** *(4th wall → the game)* | `missions[].scene` | The bridge from story to gameplay. The host steps **out** of the fiction, names the real room, then hands the crowd the rules — which is what gives them permission to commit. |

Scene beats run in order and are read straight off the console:

`cue` (stage direction, not spoken) → `fourthWall` (the step-out) → `driver`
(why this game, *tonight*) → `rules` → `callUp` (get bodies up) → `underscore`
(ad-libs while it runs) → `win` → `out` (hand back to the story).

`driver` is keyed by act — `actI` / `actII` / `actIII` — because the same game
carries different stakes while you're recruiting a crew than it does after the
score has gone down. The console reads the act off tonight's chapter and shows
the matching driver automatically, so a mission can be re-run across the season
without the story going stale. **Copy** lifts the whole scene, act-correct, as a
plain-text script.

To evolve a module for **every** brand, edit `templates/`. To change **one** brand,
edit its `brands/*.json` (+ `*.show.json`). Regenerate and redeploy. New brand = new
config = the whole system, re-skinned. Expand infinitely.

## Notes

- **Colour scheme** flows everywhere — CSS, neon glows, the photo overlay, the crew
  card and console — from seven base colours; darker shades are derived automatically.
- **Live host→crowd sync is built in.** In the Handler Console, tap **Go Live** (enter
  your `GALLERY_TOKEN` once) and every crew phone follows the current chapter, Wanted
  Level and missions within a few seconds — change them on the Show/Missions tabs and
  the whole room updates. Guests scan **one static QR**; live state overrides whatever
  the QR encoded, and falls back to the QR's values when the show isn't live.
  - It reuses the booth's Backblaze B2 (state lives in `state/<event>.json`) via the
    `show-state` function — **no new service or config.** `GET /api/show-state?event=<key>`
    is public (phones poll it); `POST` requires the `GALLERY_TOKEN`.
  - **Per-event keys** — each room/city runs its own live channel. Set an **Event key**
    in the console (e.g. `chicago`, `detroit`); its crew QR carries `?e=<key>` and only
    that room follows it. Multiple shows run simultaneously without colliding. A bare
    `crew.html` (no `?e`) follows the default `main` channel, so single-room stays simple.
- **Live crowd voting — every phone is a buzzer.** In the console's **Poll** tab, pick a
  template (Most Wanted, Find the Rat, Best Crew, Pull the job?) or write your own, tap
  **Open poll** → every crew phone shows the question and buttons; the tally rolls in live
  and **Close & reveal** pushes the winner back to the room. Votes are anonymous, one per
  member. A vote is a single tiny object whose *key* holds the option, so the whole room
  tallies with one list call — no per-vote reads. `POST /api/vote` casts; `GET /api/vote`
  tallies; no new config (same B2).
- **Points + leaderboard.** Closing a poll awards points (everyone who voted earns a little,
  whoever backed the winner earns more). The console's **Board** tab shows the live ranked
  leaderboard (put it on the big screen between rounds), and each crew card shows the
  member's own rank + points. Same list-only trick: points live in the object key
  (`points/<event>/<poll>/<member>__<pts>`), so the whole board tallies in one list call.
  `POST /api/score` awards (operator token); `GET /api/score` returns the board.
- **Operator dashboard.** The Board tab also shows tonight's numbers — **made members**,
  **polls run**, **votes cast**, plus the current chapter and wanted level. Crew check in
  when they get made (`POST /api/crew`); `GET /api/crew` returns the counts (one list each).

## Downloads (permanent)

Tagged releases attach the Show Builder apps as **Release assets, which don't expire**
(the per-run Actions artifacts are cleaned up after ~90 days). Cut one by pushing a
`v*` tag (e.g. `git tag v1.0.0 && git push origin v1.0.0`); the build workflow publishes a
GitHub Release with the Windows, macOS and Linux apps attached.
- The booth's own backend (Backblaze B2 + NAS) is unchanged and documented in the
  generated `SETUP.md`.
